# minimal-linux-kernel
This is my own, minimal linux kernel config leaning towards kernel hardening and only including modules for my specific hardware, using the Arch Build System.

It will very likely not run on your hardware, and this repository is simply a way for me to keep track of changes as the Linux kernel development advances, and as I make changes to the kernel config, or my own patch.
